# Mcc App

Todo
[ ] Tests
[ ] Add systems design diagram
[ ] Use react router in place of css to get updated states
[ ] use styled components
[ ] refactor form inputs into hook
[ ] enable addition of multiple roles
[ ] ensure proper approval process by adding users
[ ] ensure update request actually has a change
[ ] update does not auto populate on second click because component is not rerendered only hidden,
 hence once inputs are cleared it never resets defaults
[ ] use react-router to solve above
[ ] Allow events rebuild and undo state from events in UI
